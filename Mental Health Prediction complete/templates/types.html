          <p class="a-mood-disorder">
            A mood disorder that makes a person feel very sad, empty, or
            hopeless for a long time. It's more than just feeling sad for a day
            or two; it lasts for weeks or even months. People with depression
            might lose interest in activities they used to enjoy, have trouble
            sleeping, or feel very tired all the time. They might also have
            difficulty concentrating, eating too much or too little, and feeling
            worthless or guilty. Depression can affect anyone, and itâ€™s not a
            sign of weakness.

              Anxiety is a feeling of worry or fear about what might happen.
              It's like your mind is always on alert, expecting something bad.
              Sometimes, you might feel nervous for no clear reason. Your heart
              may beat fast, your hands might sweat, or you could feel dizzy.
              It's normal to feel anxious before a test or a big event, but for
              some people, these feelings happen too often and can make everyday
              life hard. This is called an anxiety disorder.

                Bipolar disorder is a mental health condition that causes
                extreme mood swings. These mood swings include emotional highs,
                known as mania or hypomania, and lows, called depression.

              <p class="during-a-manic">
                During a manic phase, a person may feel very happy, energetic,
                or overly confident. They might take risks or make impulsive
                decisions.

              <p class="during-a-depressive">
                During a depressive phase, the same person can feel very sad,
                hopeless, and lose interest in activities they once enjoyed.
                These mood changes can affect sleep, energy levels, behavior,
                and the ability to think clearly.

                Autism, or Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), is a condition that
                affects how a person thinks, learns, and interacts with others.
                People with autism often have challenges with social skills,
                communication, and repetitive behaviors. They might find it hard
                to understand social cues, such as body language or tone of
                voice, making it difficult to make friends or understand others'
                feelings.

              <p class="every-person-with">
                Every person with autism is different. Some might have strong
                skills in areas like math, art, or music, while others may need
                more help with daily tasks. Autism can be mild or severe, and
                people with autism may need different levels of support.

              <p class="schizophrenia-is-a">
                Schizophrenia is a mental illness that affects how a person
                thinks, feels, and behaves. People with schizophrenia may have
                trouble knowing what is real and what is not. They might see or
                hear things that others do not (hallucinations) or believe
                things that are not true (delusions). Their thoughts can be very
                disorganized, making it hard to talk or concentrate.
                Schizophrenia can also cause a lack of motivation and difficulty
                in expressing emotions.
